# JavaScript Quiz
This is a repository for a responsive fictional website **JavaScript Quiz** which contains a single-page quiz application with 5 questions. 
The questions are with multiple-choice answers.
In addition to validating the form at the end of the quiz, it will display the scoring results.

Also, for the footer copyright notice, the current year is set using the Date object and the getFullYear() method.

This project is done with semantic HTML5 markup, CSS styling, JavaScript function, variables, arrays, and for loops.
